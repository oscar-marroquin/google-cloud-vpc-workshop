# google-cloud-vpc-workshop
Launch a Google Cloud VPC following the cloud best practices using Terraform.


## Google Cloud Login Profile
You'll need to install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install) into your laptop or PC to securily use Terraform and deploy resources without hardcoding an **auth_file**.


## Creating a custom VPC following the Google Cloud Best Practices
In this template we'll deploy a custom VPC with 6 subnets, 3 route tables.... This template was created following and using the [Best practices and reference architectures for VPC design](https://cloud.google.com/architecture/best-practices-vpc-design).


## Conclusion
I hope this template is very useful for you, as it's for me. I'd love to hear feedback and suggestions for revisions.
